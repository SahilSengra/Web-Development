          been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
          of
          type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
          also
          the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
          1960s
          with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
          publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
